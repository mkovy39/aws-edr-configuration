2. Replication Agent Installation and Configuration

For Linux:
1. Access the EC2 console and select the EC2 instance.
2. Modify the IAM role by selecting Actions > Security > Modify IAM Role, or use the AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.
3. Use a role containing the `AWSElasticDisasterRecoveryEc2InstancePolicy` policy.
4. SSH into the instance and install the replication agent:
    - Download agent from: 
      wget -O ./aws-replication-installer-init https://aws-elastic-disaster-recovery-<REGION>.s3.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/latest/linux/aws-replication-installer-init
    - Note: Replace `<REGION>` with the AWS region.
    
    - Execute permission: 
      chmod +x aws-replication-installer-init
      
    - Run the Python script: 
      sudo ./aws-replication-installer-init
    
5. Enter AWS Region Name, Access Key ID, and Secret Access Key when prompted.

6. Select disks to replicate. The agent will handle the initial sync process, and the server will appear in the AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery console.

For Windows:
1. Download the replication agent installer:
    https://aws-elastic-disaster-recovery-<REGION>.s3.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/latest/windows/AwsReplicationWindowsInstaller.exe
    Note: Replace `<REGION>` with the AWS region.
2. Run the installer as an administrator.
3. Enter AWS Region Name, Access Key ID, and Secret Access Key when prompted.
4. Select disks to replicate. The agent will handle the initial sync process, and the server will appear in the AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery console.
